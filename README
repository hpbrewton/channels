usage:
-a simple channel implementation using circular buffers
-produces lists of numbers from items to produce to in each of the producers. 
-concurrently consumes each of the items in a consumer by writing to stdout.

channels <num producers> <num consumers> <items to produce> 

testing so far:
This is a rough start. There are some larger issues (only one lock, not 
seperate send/recv locks), it seems that a large cost comes simply
from calculating position in the circular buffer (the end function), which is
just a simple pure function, the largest cost is definitely in the reciever.
Further testing will follow.

There is also a profile file, a sample outfile (which matches logical tests  
1000001 items * 10 producers = 10000010 consumers), and an analysis.
